the pitch:
- Not to close the deal but to move them to the next stage (discovery meeting, demo ...)
- Prepare the material, short slides, keep the attention on yourself
- We're here to sell a solution, not a produt, we need to find as much information as possible, we want the client to ask questions
- Avoid questions like "Do you have any questions?", the answer is always No. Ask the strategic questions and listen to the answers => prepare questions for each slide
- "Hey look, I'm here to have a conversation. This is not a traditional pitch presentation, we're here to help you find a solution to the problem you have, so I'm gonna ask some questions throughout the presentation, what systems you guys have, challenges, do you have a vision in mind... and we can work together to have some answers"
- Try to have the next in person meeting
- Know what the next stage is, their decision making process

# TPBank Digital Core & BaaS Proposal
## Conversation-Led Executive Presentation (20 mins)

---

## Slide 1 — Executive Summary

### Left: What TPBank is asking for
- Next-generation digital banking platform
- Safe BaaS enablement (initial 5–10 partners)
- Faster time-to-market
- Strong regulatory & operational control

### Right: How we deliver
- Modern, digital-first core banking
- API-first, BaaS-ready architecture
- Phased, low-risk delivery
- Proven execution from similar transformations
---
TPBank is looking for a next-generation digital bank with safe Banking-as-a-service expansion and faster time-to-market products, while maintaining full regulatory control. 
We're excited to participate in the journey. The timing is excellent as we have recently delivered a similar digital banking transformation for a large Vietnamese bank, and we're brining the proven experience in digital core modernization and ecosystem enablement to deliver this outcome.
### Pause question
- I hope this is aligned with what you're looking for

## Slide 2 - What GFT can bring to the table
- Next-generation digital banking platform on a modern digital core
- Joint core selection using a proven evaluation process
- Step-by-step BaaS rollout starting with an MVP
- Architecture that maximizes existing systems and reduces risk
- Full IP ownership and long-term self-reliance for TPBank
---
We start this journey with the selection of the modern core banking system with our proven process to select the most suitable solution for bank's needs. This is followed by the implementation of the new Digital bank and the BaaS platform in phases. Our solution will maximize utilizing the existing systems to reduce costs and risks while also building new systems to support the new products and core. TPBank can choose to leverage this solution to fully migrate from Flexcube later.
We would like to emphasize that throughout this journey, all IP ownership belongs to TPBank, this include our design documentation, source code and all accelerator libraries that we use. GFT will work along side you to ensure that all knowledge is transferred to you, so that you can be self-relient in the long term.
### Pause question
Before we move on, I would like to ask, which aspect matters to you most right now - time-to-market, regulatory control or ease of partner's onboarding?

## Slide 3 — What happens if TPBank does NOT change now?
**Why change**
- Digital leadership gap is narrowing
- Competitors are catching up on UX & speed
- Ecosystem speed > standalone app features
- Current stack limits product & partner velocity
---
Before going into building a new digital bank and a Bank as a service platform, we need to understand the current market. TPBank is widely considered as one of the digital leaders in Vietnam. However, the gap with other competitors is narrowing quickly.
Empowered by Gen4 core banking systems, cloud technologies and AI, newer banks can now launch products much faster to the market, customize offerings more deeply and onboard new partners more easily. They're able to build ecosystems that attract customers away from the traditional banking.
At the meantime, legacy core banking systems are slow to react and rigid to customize to fit individual needs.
Contrast to popular thinking, having an app or a website doesn't make a bank digital, because we know many processes in traditional banks are still manual. Traditional banks are still slow to react to market or regulatory changes.
So the question is not whether TPBank can digitalize today but how we can build a foundation to stay ahead tomorrow.

### Pause question
Before we go further, we would like to hear your perspective - where do you feel the most pressure today? Is it ecosystem growth, automated customer journeys, or product customization?

## Slide 4 — What capabilities are required to scale Digital & BaaS?
**Capability groups**
- Customer & Partner Journeys  
  (eKYC, lending, payments, white-label apps)
- Partner flexibility 
  (tailored to customers, set pricing, limits, white-labelled app)
- Product customization
  (deep customization, complex business rules, flexible to changes)
- Ecosystem Enablement  
  (partner APIs, onboarding, monitoring, settlement)

**Key message**
- BaaS is a controlled extension of NeoBank, not uncontrolled API exposure
---
To stay ahead and meet customer's demands, the Digital Bank and the BaaS platform need to have modern capabilities provided by Gen4 Core banking systems.
First, customer and partner journeys should be automated. For example, eKYC should only take minutes and loan applications are reviewed and approved digitally without having customers go to branches.
Second, partners get the flexibility to customize the products but still stay within bank defined guardrails. For example, a partner can customize the white-labelled app with their own looks and feels but the eKYC process is still with the bank. Partners can choose their own product catalogs and adjust interest rates or fees but still stay in the thresholds set by the bank. This is to ensure the products are tailored to each partner's user base while reduce regulatory risks.
Third, the ability to deeply customize products to have specific business rules and appeal to different customer segment while reducing the time-to-market window. Products could be launched in 1-3 months instead of years.
And finally, everything is enabled through a secure, compliant and developer-friendly BaaS layer. Selective APIs are exposed to partners to support their business operations while being monitored by the bank. All activities are transparent and partners have access to their own data via a UI portal. Data ownership always stays at the bank, this is aligned with Vietnam regulations.

### Pause question:
So, may I ask, looking at these areas, which capabilities are the most critical to TPBank in the next 12 months?


## Slide 5 — How do we choose a digital core without locking ourselves in?
**Selection approach**
- Timeline 1:
    - Discovery: Requirement consolidation and business priorities
    - RFP
    - Assessment 1: Shortlist CBS vendors
    - Demo
    - Final assessment
    - CBS result and consolidation: Recommendation
- Timeline 2: starting from week 2 running in parallel with timeline 1 and use it as the input
    - Discovery and as-is architecture
    - Target architecture
    - Implementation plan, migration, 5 year TCO
    - Governance, Transition and Change Management
    - Consolidation of all deliverables
    - Presentation
---
Selecting a new core banking system is important as it's the foundation for new innovations. First, let me talk about how we ensure that the right core is selected, then I'll walk you through how we're going to do it and how long it will take.
GFT is offering to you a proven core assessment framework that has helped us deliver successful projects. This CBS assessment framework will look into all aspects of a core banking solution including architecture, extensibility, pricing model, time to market and more ... The goal is to give TPBank a comprehensive picture when comparing all CBS solutions with your requirements and find the best one.
To do this, we're running 2 pipelines in parallel. In the first pipeline, our team will consolidate business requirements and priorities, then we send out RFP to CBS providers, including platforms we have hands-on experience with such as Thought Machine, Tuum and 10x. Based on their response, we shortlist vendors and go deeper into mapping their capabilities to your requirements, demos and proof of concept if needed.
At the same time, the 2nd pipeline will focus on TPBank itself, we will have discovery sessions where our team will work with stakeholders from TPBank across business and IT to undersand your business operations and as-is architecture. This should allow us to produce a target architecture for the ecosystem, outline an implementation and migration plan and an estimation of Total cost of ownership for the next 5 years.
The result of these 2 pipelines are then consolidated into a single recommendation and presented to the board so that TPBank can make the right decision with the highest confidence.
This whole process should take us around 8 weeks.

### Pause question:
Does this selection approach give you enough confidence to move forward or is there anything you would like to emphasize more?

## Slide 6 — Assumptions
- Hosted in AWS, cloud infra is managed by TPBank, GFT to handle environment setup
- On-premise infra is managed by TPBank
- Any issue connecting from On-premise to cloud is handled by TPBank, GFT to support
- Bank to provide all TLS certificates, IP white/blacklisting, DNS, WAF configuration
- Third party software licences are accquired by TPBank
- Bank's exisitng core and card system are capable to meet new digital bank's requirements
- Partners contracts and onboarding process are handled by bank
- Partner support is bank's responsibility
- Data migration is out-of-scope

--
So before going into the architecture landscape for the next gen digital bank and the new bank as a service platform, let just quickly go through some assumptions we made when we designed this. If any of these assumptions don't reflect reality, please let me know so we can make some adjustment.
So we assume that...

### Pause question
Are these assumptions aligned with your understanding?

## Slide 7 — Architecture landscape
- Present architecture landscape

---
Let me give you a high-level view of what the future digital bank and BaaS platform could look like.

We designed this architecture based on a few simple principles.
- First, we use a cloud-native, microservices and event-driven approach so the platform can scale, stay resilient, and meet regulatory requirements.
- Second, we deliberately reuse existing systems where it makes sense and introduce a dual-core model. This reduces delivery risk while still allowing innovation.
- Third, this is a shared platform, but partner data is logically ring-fenced.
- Flexcube remains the system of record for CIF, while the new Gen4 core focuses on new products.
- And finally, partner access through BaaS is always controlled and monitored.
### Pause question:
So I'll stop here and ask folks from TPBank, are these pricniples aligned with what you have in mind?

At the center of the landscape is the new Gen4 core banking system deployed on AWS. This is where flexible product configuration and faster product launches happen. Flexcube continues to manage customer information on-premise, and we reuse SmartVista for card management, as it already meets current needs.

On top of that sits the digital and BaaS layer.
Here we build domain-based microservices for onboarding, payments, and partner management.
Partners access the platform either through white-labelled applications — which they can brand — or through selective APIs defined in OpenAPI format.
We also provide a partner portal so they can manage customers, monitor activity, and configure products within bank-defined guardrails.

All traffic flows through a secure API Gateway integrated with CIAM and reinforced with firewall.
This enforces authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and gives the bank full control — including a kill switch if needed.

Operational and transaction data is streamed into a cloud data platform for analytics, reconciliation, and accounting.
Partner data can be fed into sub-ledgers connected to your existing general ledger to support financial reporting.

Supporting capabilities like payments, eKYC, AML, fraud, and treasury can be reused or enhanced rather than rebuilt, further reducing risk and effort.
Connectivity to on-premise systems is secured via Direct Connect or VPN.

Finally, everything is logged, monitored, and audited end-to-end to ensure security, transparency, and regulatory compliance.

This gives TPBank a platform that can move fast — without losing control.
### Pause question
Does this architecutre strike the right balance between speed, control and risk or do you want us to optimize further?

---

## Slide 8 — How are non-functional & regulatory risks addressed?
**Key concerns**
- Scalability: EKS, Kafka, RDS, API Gateway, Kong ...
- Security & isolation: Cloudflare WAF, Keycloak, VPC, CodeInspector, 
- Availability & resilience: Route53, Multi AZ
- Auditability & compliance: Prometheus, Grafana, ElasticSearch, Kibana

--
The solution is designed for horizontal scalability using stateless microservices and event-driven architecture. It supports both synchronous RESTful APIs and asynchronous event streaming via Kafka, enabling high performance and extensibility. Error handling is implemented using retry with exponential backoff, dead-letter queues (DLQ), and circuit breakers.

A defense-in-depth security model is applied across all layers. API Gateway and WAF protect against OWASP Top 10 and DDoS attacks, while Keycloak and IAM provide authentication, authorization, and SSO. VPC isolation and security groups control internal traffic. Secure development is enforced via Fortify, Code Inspector, and SonarQube, with Secrets Manager and KMS used for sensitive data protection and encryption.

The platform delivers end-to-end observability through Prometheus and Grafana for metrics and alerting, and ELK for centralized logging, auditing, and operational monitoring.

High availability and resilience are achieved via multi-AZ deployment, load balancing, and automated health checks. Route 53 DNS failover supports active-active or active-standby disaster recovery configurations, enabling rapid traffic redirection during failures.

Data persistence is provided by Amazon RDS with multi-AZ replication, automated backups, and defined restore procedures to meet RPO/RTO requirements and ensure operational continuity.


### Pause:
Are there specific regulatory or operational concerns you’d like us to explore further?

## Slide 9 - Technology stack
- Mobile: Flutter, Firebase, Google analytics, crashlytics
- Web: Flutter
- Backend: Java, Spring boot, Hibernate, Kafka, OpenAPI, Avro
- Platform: AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, RDS Aurora
- Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, Elastic Search, Kibana
- Data: Python, Apache Spark, Apache Airflow
- QA: Cucumber, Postman, Testcontainers

--
To deliver the highest quality code with end-to-end tested, GFT brings the modern and industry standard technology stack for development and deployment. For mobile and web development, we utilize Flutter as the main framework to build UI/UX components which reduce time and effort for development. In the backend, all microservices shall be built with Java and Spring boot framework. These are industry standard technologies known for their extensive ecosystems and stability. We also choose Hibernate to work with relational databases and OpenAPI and Avro for better integration between services.
We plan to deploy our services to Kubernetes, hosted in AWS, with automated pipelines using Terraform. 
For better observability, we use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring, Elastic Search and Kibana for centrailized logging and audit.
The data platform pipelines are built with Python as the programming language and schedulers such as Apache Spark and Airflow.
To ensure quality control, our QA engineers utilize automation tools such as Cucumber, Postman and Testcontainers

This tech stack should give us a solid foundation to deliver the roadmap that we're about to discuss.

## Slide 9 - Roadmap
- MVP1: 1 month discovery and 7 months implementation
  - Foundation
  - Onboarding
  - Customer
  - CASA
  - Term deposit
  - Domestic payment without QR
- MVP2: 3 months
  - Credit card
  - Debit card
  - QR payment
- MVP3: 3 months
  - Secured & unsecured Loans
  - Buy now pay later
  - Cross border payment

--
Based on the business requirements and technical complexity of the project, we believe that this project can be executed in 3 phases with MVP models. In MVP 1, which includes 1 month of discovery and 7 months of implementation, we will focus on crucial services and products for the new digital bank such as Onboarding, Customer management, CASA, Term deposit and domestic payment without QR.
For the second MVP, which lasts 3 months, our focus is credit and debit card, we will also implement QR payment.
In MVP3, lending products such as secured and unsecured loans, buy now pay later are implemented. We will also touch cross border payment.

### Pause question:
Does this timeline fit your business growth plan? Or you would like us to adjust priorities?


## Slide 10 - Estimation
- MVP1: 63 FTE, 10080 MD, 5.1 mil
- MVP2: 45 FTE, 2690 MD, 1.35 mil
- MVP3: 39 FTE, 2310 MD, 1.16 mil
--
I would like you give your our estimation given the roadmap, please keep in mind that this can be negotiated further. MVP1 is the most important phase where we plan to have 63 headcounts and around 10000MD. With an average of 500 USD/day, the cost for this MVP sits around 5 millions US dollar. 
For the second MVP, we can reduce the number of headcounts to 45. With effort estimated around 2690 MD, this phase cost will be around 1.35 millions US dollar.
The 3rd MVP will have around 39 headcounts with 2310 MD and the cost is 1.16 millions dollar.

### Pause question:
I hope this has given you the full picture of the effort it would take to deliver your future banking platform. 

## Closing statement
And that is the future of TPBank that GFT is ready to deliver. I hope that we can work together to make this vision come true. Thank you

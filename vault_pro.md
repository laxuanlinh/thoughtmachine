# Smart Contract Performance
## Overview
- Simulation is better then Unit testing to test performance of `Smart Contract`
- Consider time complexity, use appropriate data structure for fast access, avoid recursions, break for loop early, use cache for API calls...
- Break code into smaller helper functions for better visibility
## Data requirement
- Hook can retrieve data multiple times and data requirement may cost performance, for example 1 year of postings
- Consider data you need for optimal data requirement
```python
# too expensive
@requires(balances="1 month live")

# much less expensive
@requires(balances="latest live")
def post_posting(vault, effective_data)
    balanaces = vault.get_balance_timeseries().latest()
```
- Only retrieve data that is absolutely necessary
```python
# unnecessarry
@requires(balances="2 months")

# just enough
@requires(balances="33 days")
```

- Code that takes too long might be `TIMEOUT` and won't be able to rerun, it also renders the accounts `unusable`
- Code that uses too much CPU can also throttle and `TIMEOUT`
